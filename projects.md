* [GNU Radio Channel Encoder & Decoder Blocks](https://github.com/riteshx95/encoder_decoder)
  <br> [C++]
  <br> The encoder block takes in data and encodes the values based on a codebook. The decoder can be used to decode this data after it has passed through a channel.
* [Scattering Wavelet Transform Based Palm Print Biometric Recognition](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/student/~riteshg/PalmPrintReport.pdf)
  <br> [MATLAB]
  <br> Palm print recognition using a camera and a scattering convolutional network.
* [3D Scene with Objects and basic Ray Tracing](https://github.com/riteshx95/scene3d)
  <br> [C++]
  <br> OpenGL scene with planes and rays and intersections and reflections.
* [Binary PWM Decoder](https://github.com/riteshx95/decoders)
  <br> [C]
  <br> A C program to decode binary PWM signals. It outputs ASCII characters.
* [Simple GSM C Library]()
  <br> [C]
  <br> A small library of GSM module functions for sending and receiving SMS, enabling & disabling data. (Working on calling functionality too)
