* [GNU Radio Channel Encoder & Decoder Blocks](https://github.com/riteshx95/encoder_decoder)
  <br> [C++]
  <br> The encoder block takes in data and encodes the values based on a codebook. The decoder can be used to decode this data after it has passed through a channel.
* [Scattering Wavelet Transform Based Palm Print Biometric Recognition](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/student/~riteshg/PalmPrintReport.pdf)
  <br> [MATLAB]
  <br> Palm print recognition using a camera and a scattering convolutional network.
