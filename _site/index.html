      Hi !

<br><br>

I am a graduate electrical engineering student.
Here you will find a decent amount of information about me and my work.
If you happen to share some of my interests, academic or otherwise, I'd be more than happy to talk about them.
<br><br>

I basically study methods in engineering but I actually am interested in science.
More often than not, I end up thinking like a scientist rather than an engineer and land in trouble.
Believe me there is a great deal of difference !
<br><br>

I believe in learning out of necessity rather than as a responsibility.
So I spend a great deal of time (sometimes too much) trying to learn things independently.
In fact, there are things I haven't understood fully even after many years of studying.
But then, here is where the true fun is !
<br><br>

So Physics, at large, is my primary study interest.
I am currently trying to understand the transition from Analytical Mechanics to Quantum Mechanics
as well as Differential Geometry for General Relativity.
<br><br>
